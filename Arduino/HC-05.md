It should blink, 1 second on and 1 second off.

Connect a serial terminal to it using a baud of 38400.

Type
> `AT`

which should then return
> `Ok`

Next, to program the name of the bluetooth device type:
>  `AT+NAME='SMARS'`

This will name the bluetooth device `SMARS`

You can now disconnect the power from the hc-05 and then reapply it, it will now be visible with the name `SMARS` from your computer.

Connect the hc-05 to your arduino using pins 2 & 3 for TX and RX. you will also need to connect it to GND and 5v.

The connections to pins 2 & 3 will need voltage splitting resistors of values 220omh.
